This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project 
I have used getStaticProps to request data 
The search is realised by custom React Hook 
The design of the app is realised by use of tailwind.css

## Getting Started

First of all ```git clone``` the repository
To add node_modules run ```yarn```
To run the project on localhost run ```yarn dev```
You can check the project by Eslint (run ```yarn lint --fix```) and prettier (run ```prettier --write src```)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
